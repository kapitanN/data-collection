What was done:
  1. Developed back-end methods end front-end view for render all created fields. In this page we can delete any field or redirect to
edit field page or create field's page.
  2. Developed create field page. In this page we can select required parameteres for field. When Radio button or Combobox is chosen
text area appears, where we can write options. After submitting all data is saved in database and we are redirected to all fields page,
where is displayed new field. After editing data is updated in database and we are redirected to all fields page. Options for radio button
and combobox save in database too. In page for submitting user's data this options reads and output suitable field type.
  3. Developed responses page. Here is display data for all users. if user has empty field, cell is filled in N/A.
  4. Developed page for submit user's data.  Data submit via websocket and display on the page congratulation for submit data without
refresh the page.

What wasn't done:
  1. User can't submit data with radio and combo, because it sends just last value in the list. I couldn't solve it in time.
